          Daniel was born as unlucky as they come: poor, fat, short, bullied, and only has his mother. The only person Daniel knows how to talk back to is his mother, and one day his mother catches Daniel being bullied at school. Feeling ashamed to let his mother catch him in such an embarrassing position, Daniel tells his mother to leave because they are his friends and is not being bullied. His mother leaves but knows better and tells Daniel when he returned home later that night that she is sending him to a different school for a better life because she has failed him. But his mother cannot come with him as she is working in the only job that will hire her and sends Daniel off by himself.
