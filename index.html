        <p>This story is about Nie Li who was reincarnated into his 13 year old body after his death in his previous life. Nie Li's previous life was one with many difficulties and challenges. After the destruction of his city (Glory City) and the death of his entire family and friends, and his lover (Ye ZiYun) from the demon attack, Nie Li was forced to flee with many other people from Glory City. Nie Li traveled throughout the world and accumulated a huge amount of knowledge and skills before his death. After his reincarnation, Nie Li, with his high-leveled knowledge that easily surpasses everyone in Glory City, promises to fix all the misfortunes in his previous life, such as saving his friends, family, Glory City, and his past life's lover (Ye ZiYun) from their untimely death from the demon attack. <a href="pages/manhua/2017/04/15/review-tales-of-demons-and-gods/tales-of-demons-and-gods.html">Read More.</a></p>
