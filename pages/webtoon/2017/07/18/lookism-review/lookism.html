        <h2>Story</h2>
        <p>
          Daniel was born as unlucky as they come: poor, fat, short, bullied, and only has his mother. The only person Daniel knows how to talk back to is his mother, and one day his mother catches Daniel being bullied at school. Feeling ashamed to let his mother catch him in such an embarrassing position, Daniel tells his mother to leave because they are his friends and is not being bullied. His mother leaves but knows better and tells Daniel when he returned home later that night that she is sending him to a different school for a better life because she has failed him. But his mother cannot come with him as she is working in the only job that will hire her and sends Daniel off by himself.
        </p>
        <p>
          Daniel, feeling happy to finally be able to escape his current tormented high school life but sad that he has to leave his mother behind simply because he cannot take care of himself, leaves to his new school only to get bullied before even attending school. Pouring his heart out for failing his mother once again while cursing at the world for being so unfair to him, Daniel cries himself to sleep. When Daniel wakes up, he finds himself in a new body, one that is blessed from every angle: looks, height, and strength. But Daniel didn't just get a new body, he still has his old body that sleeps when his new body is awake and vice-verse.
        </p>
        <p>
          While attending school in his new body, Daniel notices that he is treated like a celebrity simply because he is handsome, tall, and strong. While attending high school in his new body, Daniel learns that his new body may be better but his personality is still that of a "loser". While living his life through his new body, Daniel comes across many new and familiar faces that directly and indirectly teaches him that his old body is all he ever needed and that true strength comes from working hard and not by blaming others or the world for your misfortune. Thus, he begins his journey on becoming both the man he can be proud of and the son his mother truly deserves.
