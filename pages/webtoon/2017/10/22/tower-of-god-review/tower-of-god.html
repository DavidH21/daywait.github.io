        <h2>First Look</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>- About a naive kid in the real world for the first time</li>
          <li>- Weird fighting system</li>
          <li>- Starting story is interesting</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Story</h2>
        <p>The story is about a boy named "The 25th Bam", or Bam for short, who lived in a dark "cave" all by himself until he met a girl named Rachel who taught him how to read, talk, and many basic things. Everyone lives within a "box" with the sky and stars being man-made. Rachel eventually wants to go up the Tower to chase after her dream of seeing the real stars, while Bam wishes for everything to stay the same and it being just him and Rachel. Bam, unable to stop Rachel, chases after her and they both enter the Tower unexpectedly. Bam and Rachel, both an irregular (a person who was not chosen by the Tower to enter), enter the Tower at two different time. Bam decides to go up the unforgiving Tower to chase after Rachel, while Rachel goes up the Tower to chase after the stars. Irregulars are feared in the Tower because all of the irregulars who came into the Tower all caused chaos and disruption. Bam meets many kinds of people while going up the Tower in search for Rachel, each wanting to have their desires granted, and experiences many new things, both bad and good, he could not have if it were just him and Rachel.

        <h2>Day Wait's Thoughts</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>- Weak story, story goes matter-of-factly.</li>
          <li>- Fighting system is lacking. Not much action</li>
          <li>- Weak character development.</li>
          <li>- Likeable characters</li>
          <li>- Interesting even though the story isn't very strong</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Others</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>- A fun read if you have time. 300+ chapters</li>
          <li>- Free official English version at <a href="http://www.webtoons.com/en/fantasy/tower-of-god/list?title_no=95" rel="nofollow">Webtoons</a></li>
